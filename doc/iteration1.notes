Dependencies so far:
Python 2.6
Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com)

Networking
==========

Justification for twisted
- twisted is a framework for writing network servers and can abstract away the intricacies of network programming (asynchronous communication in a threaded environment)
- it offers flexibility by supporting several transport and application protocols, e.g. UDP, TCP, HTTP
- having a framework means imposing a structure on the code, meaning room to grow should the server become more complex
- written in pure python, so no additional dependencies - can be installed through setup.exe (windows) or easy_install

There are two approaches to writing twisted networking applications, one is to use a supported transport such as TCP and build my own network protocol on top of it. The other is to use twisted's own perspective broker, a serialization and RPC protocol to call methods on the 'other side' directly.

Pros and Cons of each:

Regular protocol
----------------
+ Clients wishing to access the server use a standard protocol and are not tied to twisted
+ Well supported libraries in every language
- Have to build custom protocol on top - packing/unpacking data, order of arguments

Perspective Broker
------------------
+ Serialization and RPC, transfer entire objects
- Clients are tied to twisted now, meaning clients must use python

Modelling
=========
How to model/represent game objects?

Estimated number of game objects:

Map
---
1 square mile area (1.6 km^2)
River
	- Generate contour map, keep only the lowest points (which form a river)
Roads
Fields
	- Voronoi? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
Houses
Forest
Haystacks
Grassland

Persistence
===========
Need a way to store game state

SQLite
	High performance, embeddable, table-based
yAML
	Maps well to objects, needs third party library

Testing
=======
Code should be unit-tested, approaches are:
- http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html
- http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html
