Dependencies so far:
Python 2.6
Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com)

Justification for twisted
- twisted is a framework for writing network servers and can abstract away the intricacies of network programming (asynchronous communication in a threaded environment)
- it offers flexibility by supporting several transport and application protocols, e.g. UDP, TCP, HTTP
- having a framework means imposing a structure on the code, meaning room to grow should the server become more complex
- written in pure python, so no additional dependencies - can be installed through setup.exe (windows) or easy_install
